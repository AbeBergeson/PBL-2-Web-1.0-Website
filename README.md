This is a project from the course ISOM 210 to fit the PBL project 2 requirements. This website includes a main homepage (index), multiple branch pages (about, contact, order, submit), with an interactive order sheet for a hypothetical customer to fill out.
Some web 1.0 websites did not have an interactive order sheet, so the website also makes sure you call and confirm the phone number to ensure the order was placed
